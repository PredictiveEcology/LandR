\usage{
overlayStacks(
  highQualityStack,
  lowQualityStack,
  outputFilenameSuffix = "overlay",
  destinationPath
)
}
\arguments{
\item{highQualityStack}{high quality list/stack of rasters
(will be used preferentially)}

\item{lowQualityStack}{low quality list/stack of rasters
(will be used to fill \code{NA}s in \code{highQualityStack})}

\item{outputFilenameSuffix}{file suffix to save raster if there was overlaying.
Defaults to \code{"overlay"}.}

\item{destinationPath}{path to data directory where objects will be downloaded or saved to}
}
\description{
Overlays rasters of different data resolution by filling in gaps in the highest
resolution raster with data available in lowest resolution one.
If only high or low resolution data are available, it will use it without
attempting to overlay.
}
