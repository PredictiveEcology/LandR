\usage{
overlayLCCs(
  LCCs,
  forestedList,
  outputLayer,
  NAcondition,
  NNcondition,
  remapTable = NULL,
  classesToReplace,
  availableERC_by_Sp,
  forestEquivalencies = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{LCCs}{A named list or named \code{RasterStack} of layers whose content
is Land Cover Class.}

\item{forestedList}{A named list of same length and names as \code{LCCs} indicating
which classes in each LCC raster are 'forested', either permanent or transient}

\item{outputLayer}{A character string that matches one of the named elements
in \code{LCCs}. This will be the classification system returned.}

\item{NAcondition}{The condition when a pixel is deemed to be \code{NA}.
Given as a character string of a vectorized logical statement that will be
within the \code{forestEquivalencies} table.
It should be a set of conditions with \verb{== 0}, i.e., non-forested.
Examples:, e.g., \code{"LCC2005 == 0"} or \code{"CC == 0 | LCC2005 == 0"},
where \code{0} is the non-forested pixels based on converting LCCs and
\code{forestedList} to \code{1} and \code{0}.}

\item{NNcondition}{The 'nearest-neighbour' condition; i.e., the condition when
a nearest-neighbour search is done to fill in the pixel with forested type.
Given as a character string of a vectorized logical statement that will be
parsed within the \code{forestEquivalencies} table.
It should be a set of conditions with \verb{== 0}, i.e., non-forested.
Examples:, e.g., \code{"LCC2005 == 0"} or \code{"CC == 0 | LCC2005 == 0"},
where \code{0} is the non-forested pixels based on converting LCCs and
\code{forestedList} to \code{1} and \code{0}.}

\item{remapTable}{\code{data.table}. This would be for a situation where
2 LCC layers are provided, one has information in a pixel, but not the one
which is \code{outputLayer}, so this needs a reclassify or remap.}

\item{classesToReplace}{Passed to \code{convertUnwantedLCC}, for the pixels where
\code{NNcondition} is \code{TRUE}}

\item{availableERC_by_Sp}{Passed to \code{convertUnwantedLCC}, for the pixels where
\code{NNcondition} is \code{TRUE}. If this is \code{NULL}, then it will be
created internally with all pixels with:
\code{data.table(initialEcoregionCode = LCCs[[outputLayer]][])}}

\item{forestEquivalencies}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{NULL}.
If \code{NULL}, this function will derive this table automatically from the
other arguments. Otherwise, the user must provide a \code{data.frame} with
\code{length(LCCs) + 1} columns, and \code{2 ^ length(LCCs)} rows.
Currently not used.}
