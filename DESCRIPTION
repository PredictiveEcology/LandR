Title: Landscape Ecosystem Modelling in R
Description: Utilities for 'LandR' suite of landscape simulation models.
    These models simulate forest vegetation dynamics based on LANDIS-II, and 
    incorporate fire and insect disturbance, as well as other important ecological
    processes. Models are implemented as 'SpaDES' modules.
